<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dawids-article">Dawid’s Article</h2>
<p>Dawid argues that because we never observe both treated and untreated outcomes for the same units, we are dangerously wading into metaphysical terrain and that ultimately this renders causal inference in its counterfactual formulation untestable and unfalsifiable. I suppose I’m giving away the ending, but a large handful of eminent statisticians wrote responses to this article disagreeing quite substantially with its premises.</p>
<p>Dawid does have a few choice quotes that I particularly agree with:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nature is surely utterly indifferent to our attempts to ensnare her in our theories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As long as a model appears to describe the relevant aspects of the world satisfactorily, we may continue, cautiously to use it; when it fails to do so, we need to search for a better one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here we get into the substance of issue:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My approach is grounded in a Popperian philosophy, in which the meaningfulness of a purportedly scientific theory, proposition, quantity, or concept is related to the implications it has for what is or could be observed … When this is the case, assertions are empirically refutable and are considered “scientific.” When this is not so, they may be branded “metaphysical.” I argue that counterfactual theories are essentially metaphysical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll be discussing what this “Popperian philosophy” exactly is and the role philosophy of science has in this conversation at length, but for now let’s establish a few more facts about Dawid’s argument.</p>
<section id="types-of-causal-inference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-causal-inference">Types of Causal Inference</h3>
<p>Dawid draws our attention to the difference in nature between two types of questions, which can be characterized by archetypal examples.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“I have a headache. Will it help if I take aspirin?”</li>
<li>“My headache has gone. Was it because I took aspirin?”</li>
</ol>
<p>While Dawid contrasts these as being about <span class="vocab">“effects of causes”</span> and <span class="vocab">“causes of effects,”</span> I find that language is a little bit tricky to follow. Perhaps it is because of my prior knowledge, but I immediately recast these in my mind into the language of “token” and “type” causation, where <span class="vocab">token causation</span> refers to causal inference with respect to a specific event and <span class="vocab">type causation</span> refers to causal inference regarding trends in events. In other words, we could take climate related events as an example: “Did climate change cause this storm?” and “Does climate change increase storm intensity?” The former is an example of token causation and in general is thought by many to be much harder to establish. The latter is an example of a question about type causation and is more firmly in the realm of what we usually think of when we think about observational causal inference questions.</p>
<p>In the case of Dawid’s examples, I view question 1 as being a question of type causation because at-best we can apply our knowledge about trends in outcomes under aspirin treatment and non-treatment to make some prediction about what might happen in the future under aspirin treatment and non-treatment circumstances. Meanwhile, I view question 2 as a question of token causation: without knowing much more, it’s hard to know if the person in question was simply dehydrated and the water they drank with their aspirin was the more causally significant explanatory variable or perhaps the headache just went away on its own.</p>
<p>Later on, Dawid has this to say about what I would call inference regarding token causation:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>No amount of wishful thinking, clever analysis, or arbitrary untestable assumptions can license unambiguous inference about causes of effects, even when the model is simple and the data are extensive (unless one is lucky enough to discover uniformity among units).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Wishful thinking” and “clever analysis,” I agree with, but arbitrary untestable assumptions can get you pretty far — But I agree with him in principle here. I think it’s practically impossible to take a recorded history and give a rigorous treatment to why it played out the way it did using statistical machinery, as far as I can tell. This is in large part due to the problem of fundamental causes: eventually we’ll get to a statement like “X happened because the Universe began” which is profoundly unsatisfying.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-decision-analytic-framework" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-decision-analytic-framework">A Decision-Analytic Framework</h3>
<p>I find this a bit strange, but Dawid claims that “the counterfactual approach typically takes as the fundamental object of causal inference the <span class="vocab"> <em>individual causal effect</em></span>…”</p>
<p>I can’t tell if it’s that I’m not very familiar with what the field of causal inference looked like pre-1980 or so, or if it’s just that this is a mischaracterization. Either way, what I’m familiar with is exclusively causal inference literature that takes as its main object of interest the <span class="vocab"><em>average treatment effect</em></span> or another population-level treatment effect (perhaps conditioned if thinking about effect-heterogeneity).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Dawid mounts criticism of the counterfactual framework as involving “metaphysical” variables (variables we do not directly observe) and suggests a Bayesian decision-analytic alternative to the counterfactual formulation of causal inference instead.</p>
<p>Rather than investigating the properties of <span class="math inline">\(Y_1 - Y_0\)</span> (the individual causal effect) (or even <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb E[Y_1] - \mathbb E[Y_0]\)</span>, the average treatment effect), instead Dawid suggests that what we should do is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Restrict our studies to perfectly homogeneous populations so as to banish any potential confounders;</li>
<li>Look at the “physical array” of values representing the outcomes of treated and untreated units to develop a prediction model;</li>
<li>And for any questions about whether or not treatment should be assigned in the future, we should use a Bayesian decision-theoretic model to infer the optimality choice based on the distributions of observed outcomes for treated vs.&nbsp;untreated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dawid does grant that models could be developed for nonhomogeneous populations, suggesting that “symmetry arguments” can be used to “justify the construction of certain random-effects-type models …”</p>
<p>He goes on to say, “As long as one’s models relate the responses of the new and the old units (under arbitrary treatment assignments), and so support the required predictive inferences, one can conduct whatever decision-analytic analysis appears most relevant to one’s purpose, eschewing counterfactuals entirely.”</p>
<p>It seems to me that one of the following two statements must be true, depending on how comfortable Dawid is with the line of thought that the decision-analytic framework could support nonhomogeneous populations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Restricting causal inference to only homogeneous populations would be incredibly restrictive and would render a huge number of problems for which data already exist in economics, sociology, health sciences, and education un-workable.</li>
<li>If we’re allowing ourselves to control for potential confounders in prediction models that are used for a Bayesian decision-analytic approach, I’m suspicious we’re treading awfully close to a modeling approach that, while in its description may sound different, is fundamentally doing something extremely similar to the usual counterfactual approach.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="philosophy-and-fatalism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="philosophy-and-fatalism">Philosophy and “Fatalism”</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Many counterfactual analyses are based, explicitly or implicity, on an attitude that I term <em>“fatalism.”</em> This considers the various potential responses <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(u)\)</span>, when treatment <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is applied to unit <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, as predetermined attributes of unit <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, waiting only to be uncovered by suitable experimentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a little bit hard here to disentangle whether Dawid is talking about 1) whether the Universe is a deterministic or stochastic place, or 2) whether he’s saying that counterfactuals are themselves random or fixed variables.</p>
<p>However, he goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For example, it [the fatalistic worldview] leaves no scope for introducing realistic stochastic effects of external influences acting between times of application of treatment and of the response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it sounds a lot like he’s saying he thinks that much of the approach of counterfactual causal inference is rooted in an assumption that the counterfactual is itself <em>not a random variable</em>, which I just simply don’t agree with as that’s not a presentation or approach I’ve ever seen advocated for.</p>
</section>
<section id="have-we-constructed-a-strawman" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="have-we-constructed-a-strawman">Have we constructed a strawman?</h3>
<p>At one point (section 9.1), Dawid says that the average causal effect (in his notation: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb E_p\{f(Y_t) - f(Y_c)\}\)</span>) (I take in a population where exchangeability, positivity, and consistency hold) is just <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb E_P \{f(Y_t)\} - \mathbb E_P \{ f(Y_c) \}\)</span> and this only depends on the marginal distributions.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hence this particular use of counterfactual analysis, focusing on an infinite population ACE, is consistent with the decision-analytic approach and involves only terms subject to empirical scrutiny. It is fortunate that many of the superficially counterfactual analyses in the literature, from Rubin (1978) onward, have in fact confined attention to ACE and thus lead to acceptable conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I’m questioning what exactly Dawid is attacking given that he clearly says much of the causal inference literature is acceptable.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">“Conclusions”</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is no magical statistical route that can bypass the need to do real science to attain the clearest possible understanding of the operation of relevant (typically nondeterministic) causal mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack there. First, I think it’s a real bold move to assume that you can litigate what “real” science is and isn’t. Second, it’s news to me if we’ve settled the debate on whether the universe is deterministic or not, but insofar as its relevant to this discussion, it doesn’t really matter as long as long as the best models we have for sufficiently complex future outcomes are those of <em>random</em> data generation mechanisms.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="responses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="responses">Responses</h2>
<section id="cox" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cox">Cox</h3>
<p>Of all the responses, I thought the one that hit the nail on the head was David R. Cox’s:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>has the philosophical coherence, if not thrown the baby out with the bathwater, at least left the baby seriously bruised in some vital organs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: is Dawid making perfect the enemy of good?</p>
<p>I agree with Cox that “it is hard to disagree with Dawid’s distate for assumptions that can never be tested… Yet at a work-a-day level, the point is more that any assumptions should not be pressed too far beyond the limits to which they can be tested, and importantly, that assumptions can be tested indirectly via their consequences as well as directly.”</p>
<p>I think Cox also raises an interesting philosophical question about causality, which is that is causal inference truly causal if it lacks explanation? As in, if a carefully randomized experiment (or even series of experiments) shows that T produces higher responses than C, but no understanding as to how is established, is it the case that causality has been established? “In one sense it has, and yet I believe that many working scientists would be uneasy using the term in such situations.”</p>
</section>
<section id="casella-and-schwartz" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="casella-and-schwartz">Casella and Schwartz</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dawid insists that such choices, and inferences, must be based on strict principles that can be verified empirically. We believe that such a program is so overly rigid that, in the end, science is not served.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of particular note to me is the historical evidence that Casella and Schwartz bring to the table&nbsp;— already in 1748, philosopher David Hume was thinking about causal inference and making the distinction of token vs.&nbsp;type causation:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connection among events arises from a number of similar instances which occur, of the constant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by any one of these instances surveyed in all possible lights and positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Casella and Schwartz also note that it feels like Dawid has substantially changed the inferential target of interest from the average causal effect to the decision-theoretically important quantity <span class="math inline">\(u_0 | \text{treatment} = t\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="pearl" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pearl">Pearl</h3>
<p>Pearl calls our attention to the historical track record of criticism on account of “metaphysics”:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The field of statistics has seen many well-meaning crusades against threats from metaphysics and other heresy. In its founding prospectus of 1834, the Royal Statistical Society resolved “to exclude carefully all Opinions from its transactions and publication——to confine its attention rigorously to facts.” This clause was officially struck out in 1858, when it became obvious that facts void of theory could not take statistics very far (<em>Annals of the Royal Statistical Society</em> 1934, p.&nbsp;16).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to argue that the word “counterfactual” itself is a bit of a misnomer, and that any scientific law that establishes relationships between observable variables remains invariant when the values of those variables change. As an example, he provides a counterfactual-esque reading of Ohm’s law (V = IR) in which we could say <em>if</em> the resistance and voltage in a circuit were particular values, <em>then</em> we can solve for the current in that circuit. Pearl doesn’t quite come out and say it, but the fundamental “<em>metaphysical</em>” assumption here is that the laws of physics are invariant across time and space. Second, functions in general can be thought of as counterfactuals: <em>if</em> we substitute a particular value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <em>then</em> we can use the rules of algebra and arithmetic to calculate the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. I thought this was one of the most damning criticisms of Dawid’s argument.</p>
<p>Pearl launches what is, in my view, another devastating (though less well supported) attack against Dawid’s line of thought— if we limit the language of science to exclusively entertain purely falsifiable ideas, what happens to inspiration and creativity in scientific pursuits? As examples, Pearl brings up how it was the Greek astronmers with their mythical creative-speculative strategies wild with metaphysical imagery of circular tubes, full of fire, and a hemispherical Earth riding on turtle backs that inspired Eratosthenes (276-194 BC) to design an experiment to measure the radius of the Earth (and it wasn’t the exacting, black-box computational culture of the Babylonians). Second, he says that it was precisely due to early 20th century physicists daring to ask “metaphysical” questions about physical properties of electrons when electrons are un-observable that inspired quantum physics.</p>
<p>It is at once reasonable to me that demanding rigidity in our language and in our experimental designs could be stifling to science, and yet I am usually averse to “proof by example” as has been presented by Pearl. It is at once hard to interpret the examples Pearl has brought forward as anything but cherry-picked, and yet I believe that whole fields of dignified science (anthropology, sociology) can admit excellent work by finding what are archetypal examples of social processes and studying them.</p>
<p>Pearl’s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The success of the counterfactual language stems from two ingredients necessary for scientific progress in general: (a) the use of modeling languages that are somewhat richer than the ones needed for routine predictions, and (b) the use of powerful mathematics to filter, rather than muzzle, the untestable queries that such languages tempt us to ask.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="james-robins-and-sander-greenland">James Robins and Sander Greenland</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We are confident that Dawid does not wish to join R. A. Fisher (1959) in thereby concluding that causal inferences from observational data are illegitimate, including the inference that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer (Stolley 1991). If we are correct, then Dawid has no choice but to recognize the need for untestable assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our conclusion is not to reject counterfactual models, however, but rather to criticize models and measures of effect that depend on nonidentifiable features (Greenland 1987) and to develop semiparametric counterfactual models (i.e., structural nested models, marginal structural models, and models based on the g-computation algorithm) that place no restrictions on those features (Robins 1997, 1999). Our approach completely obviates Dawid’s concern.</p>

<p>It took me a bit to figure out that the Bard they’re referring to might be Shakespeare, and they’re misquoting (deliberately) the line from the play Julius Caeser, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”</p>

<p>“I prefer the more generous expression ‘potential outcomes’ to ‘counterfactuals’ to describe the perspective, because as Dawid himself points out before his equation (5), it is only after treatment assignments are known that some potential outcomes become known, whereas others become counterfactual.</p>
<p>Rubin goes on to argue that Dawid has been overly dismissive of the value of the counterfactual perspective, naming both the effectiveness to which he has been able to teach it to students to their great insight, and the utility it holds in rendering otherwise complex seemingly-paradoxical questions like Lord’s paradox much more straightforward.</p>

<p>Shafer is the only responder who seems to support Dawid’s view, saying “my main reservation about the article is that it does not take advantage of Dawid’s own path-breaking work on predictive probability … In his effort to find common ground with those who tout counterfactual variables, Dawid emphasizes the case of a finite homogeneous population, where optimal predictions are merely population average … In the end, Dawid concedes too much, especially on the topic of causes of effects.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wasserman">Wasserman</h3>
<p>Wasserman continues the line of thought started by Rubin, arguing that Simpson’s paradox is so easily resolved when cast in counterfactual language. He disputes how the analogy to incompatible quantum variables may be misrepresentative, saying that our inability to measure two incompatible variables is built into the quantum mechanics, whereas this is not the case for all situations in which we might apply counterfactual causal inference. For example, in principle, an idealized experiment in which both <span class="math inline">\(Y_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> are observed is feasible if we allow ourselves to consider different treatment over time when either carryover effects are minimal or we can wait them out before the next trial.</p>

<p>I suggest that we continue to use counterfactuals but educate users to resist the temptation to indiscriminantly make inferences for nonidentified parameters in all models, not just causal models.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dawids-response">Dawid’s Response</h3>
<p>Dawid admits that to address the responses, “I have to accept that a vital aspect of causal modeling and inference is the identification of modular subprocesses.”</p>
<p>He seems to stick to his guns, saying</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>However, I do not feel that the counterfactual approach to causal inference has, as yet, provided any of these advantages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues the premise of Pearl’s argument about the richness of languages, suggesting that he believes that the Bayesian decision-analytic framework may be an even richer language than that of counterfactual causal inference.</p>
<p>Finally, he proposes the following framework for evaluating the theory of counterfactual causal inference, asking where on each scale counterfactual causal inference falls:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fact <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> Fiction. Are counterfactuals to be regarded as genuine features of the external world, or are they purely theoretical terms?</li>
<li>Real <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> Instrumental. Can any inferences based on counterfactuals be allowed, or should they be restricted to those that could in principle be formulated without mention of counterfactuals?</li>
<li>Clear <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> Vague. Do counterfactual terms in a model have a clear relationship with meaningful aspects of the problem addressed? Can counterfactual constructions and arguments help to clarify understanding?</li>
<li>Helpful <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> Dangerous. Can use of counterfactuals streamline thinking and assist analyses, or do they promote misleading lines of arguments and false conclusions?</li>
</ol>

<section id="my-responses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-responses">My Responses</h2>
<p>I’ll bite: let’s think through the dimensions that Dawid proposes, taking into account the ways of thinking that the responses offered as well.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fact or Fiction? If we think about the extent to which the treated vs. untreated arms physically, undeniably demonstrate the possible outcomes with no recourse to metaphysical hypotheses, we can certainly say that when adjustment for confounders doesn’t take the potential outcomes for either group far outside the region of observed data in (covariate, treatment assignment) space, we can certainly refer to the fact-of-the-matter that the counterfactuals posited have support in real-life observed data. Things get trickier in general when we are using models to generate predictions far outside the region of support for which we have observations in (covariate, treatment assignment) space, but in general extrapolation is a hard problem and not a feature of counterfactual causal inference specifically — just something to be careful of.</li>
<li>Real or Instrumental? Not sure how Dawid intends for anyone to answer this? “Should” counterfactual analyses be allowed? Sure.</li>
<li>Clear vs.&nbsp;Vague? I’d say one of the best things the field of counterfactual causal inference has brought to bear is its emphasis on causal diagram presentation which have rendered clarity to a number of complex social questions, and especially with the rules for d-separation, determining backdoor paths, etc., the lucid clarity that counterfactual causal inference has brought to a wide number of problems is nothing to scoff at.</li>
<li>Helpful or Dangerous? I suspect whether or not an analysis is helpful or dangerous is independent of whether or not an analyst uses counterfactual causal inference, but rather a feature of the degree to which the analyst harbors dangerous world-views such as those of eugenics, white supremacy, biological essentialism, a disregard for human rights, and comfort with twisting the facts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I’d just like to turn Dawid’s argument around on him for just a moment: is it not the case that the predictions necessary for his suggested Bayesian decision-analytic necessitate so-called metaphysical assumptions? For example, one must obtain a prediction, which, if we admit that statistical predictions are uncertain even in best-case scenarios, then we are forced to acknowledge that either:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We can never validate a single prediction (since we can always resort to saying it was just an exceptionally low-probability outlier in the probability distribution model of the prediction), or</li>
<li>We would have to validate it through a <em>sample</em> of repeated observations on the same unit, but of course this suggests that the treatment effect needs to be invariant over time on the same unit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the second statement here is similar to the unit treatment value assumption, where I don’t fully buy that this is an untestable, metaphysical assumption as Dawid claims it is. We can use tools like stratification to test for effect heterogeneity — and broadly speaking, as Pearl points out, either these assumptions are insignificant and hence have no meaningful effect, or they are significant and hence can be observed in their ramifications.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to point out that the truly untestable, metaphysical assumption that Dawid’s decision-analytic framework suffers from in equal measure as the counterfactual causal inference paradigm does is the need to assume that no unmeasured confounders exist. Importantly, it could be a <em>very bad thing</em> if one uses a decision-analytic model that did not capture an important confounder to decide on a treatment policy for an individual and got it wrong.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions-1">Conclusions</h2>
<p>What have we learned (that felt nontrivial)?</p>
<p>I particularly like Pearl’s analogizing causal inference to that of learning functions. The framing that, broadly speaking, our posited laws of physics are hypothesized relationships between variables such that <em>if</em> some variables hold particular values, <em>then</em> we would expect to see other variables become determined feels like its taking “counterfactual” causal inference from the domain of speculative language and transforming it into codified statements about what we know about how the universe works.</p>
<p>I need to think more deeply about the appropriateness of pragmatism in science. On the one hand, it feels reasonable that we should not hold ourselves so rigidly to a philosophical rigor that would cast most science as ineffective. On the other hand, pragmatism is present in ideas I am deeply skeptical of (such as that predictive models need not effectively capture causal relations). Cox’s example where we can imagine observing through perfect randomized controlled trials that a treatment has a statistically significant effect compared to the control, but with no explanatory mechanism detailed, should we act on this knowledge? It might be pragmatic to do so, but as Cox suggests, there is a part of me that feels squeamish about using knowledge founded atop at-best shaky grounds to make important decisions.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that no one involved seemed to change their minds. A few points here and there were conciliatorily granted, but it is not as if either the counterfactualists responding or Dawid admitted defeat. For me, I can only take this as indication that 1) when someone has deeply held beliefs (e.g., science shouldn’t be based on unverifiable, metaphysical quantities; counterfactual causal inference has been working well, etc.) they will rarely let them go, and 2) the significant impact of this paper is in the ways in which it may have helped to shape young readers’ perspectives.</p>
<p>There is something valuable here, and Pearl is probably the writer who came closest to explicitly acknowledging it, but it appears that Dawid’s criticisms of counterfactual causal inference has the effect of sharpening the ways the counterfactualists think about their work and how they talk about it. It seems most plausible that when sharply targeted jabs in theory are traded back-and-forth in journal articles between careful, thoughtful colleagues, the typical pupil set to receive the battle-tested treatment of the theory will have a particularly challenging time taking issue with their instructors’ presentation.</p>
