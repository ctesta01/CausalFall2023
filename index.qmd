During the Fall 2023 I'm doing a reading-based independent study 
and writing up my notes to share here from some classic and modern 
texts in causal inference with a particular interest on a few subtopics
including 1) complex mediators, 2) the role of semiparametric methods,
and 3) doubly-robust learning.
