Notes on <i>Marginal Structural Models and Causal Inference in Epidemiology</i> by James M. Robins, Miguel Ángel Hernán, and Babette Brumback (2000), Epidemiology

<https://doi.org/10.1097/00001648-200009000-00011>

## Introduction 

The key problem this paper addresses is the bias induced by time-dependent confounders that
are also affected by previous treatment — which are handled by the introduction of 
marginal structural models that can be consistently estimated using inverse-probability-of-treatment 
weighted (IPTW) estimators. 

**Definition.** <span style='vocab'>Time-dependent confounders</span> are covariates that are a 
risk factor for, or predictor of, the event of interest and also predicts subsequent exposure. 

We are particularly interested in time-dependent confounders that are also affected or predicted 
by past exposure history (Condition 2). 

## Time-Dependent Confounding

> Consider a follow-up study of HIV-infected patients. Let $A_k$ be
the dose of the treatment or exposure of interest, say zidovudine (AZT)
on the $k$th day since start of follow-up. Let $Y$ be a dichotomous outcome of interest
(for example, $Y = 1$ if HIV RNA is not detectable in the blood and 0 otherwise)
measured at end of follow-up on day $K+1$. Our goal is to estimate the time-dependent
treatment $A_k$ on the outcome $Y$.

Let $L_k$ represent the vector of all measured risk factors on day $k$ for the
outcome such as age, CD4 lymphocyte count, white blood count, hematocrit, 
diagnosis of AIDS, and presence of absence of symptoms and opportunistic infections. 
Let $U_k$ represent the value(s) on day $k$ of all unmeasured causal risk factors
for $Y$.

```

Before diving immediately into how to address time-varying confounding that 
is affected by antecedent exposures, we establish some preliminary findings
in the setting of point-treatment studies. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='35%', fig.cap="Figure 2 |> a. A causal graph for a point-exposure.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("standalone_figures/point_exposure1/point_exposure1.svg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='35%', fig.cap="Figure 2b. Similar to above but missing the arrow from $U_0 \to A_0$.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("standalone_figures/point_exposure2/point_exposure2.svg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='35%', fig.cap="Figure 2c. Again similar to above but missing the arrow from $L_0 \to A_0$.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("standalone_figures/point_exposure3/point_exposure3.svg")
```

I think Robins, Hernán, and Brumback summarize the problem with time-varying confounders
so well in section 7.1 that I want to repeat their statement here in my introduction: 

> ... Standard regression methods adjust for covariates by including them in the model as regressors. These standard methods may fail to adjust appropriately for confounding due to measured confounders $L_k$ when treatment is time varying because (1) $L_k$ may be a confounder for later treatment and thus must be adjusted for, but (2) may also be affected by earlier treatment and thus should not be adjusted for by standard methods. A solution to this conundrum is to adjust for the time-dependent covariates $L_k$ by using them to calculate the weights $sw_i$ rather than by adding $L_k$ to the
regression model as regressors. 

## Background — Counterfactuals in Point-Treatment Studies

In an effort to help orient the readers, the authors provide some basic background
on causal inference in point-treatment studies (Figures 2a-2c) to help keep us all
grounded before moving on to more complicated settings. 

Through this section ($\S2$) the authors contrast <span class='vocab'>crude measures</span> with <span class='vocab'>causal measures</span>
explaining that the causal measures will equal the crude measures when the 
analysis is unconfounded. 

$$cRD = Pr[Y = 1 | A_0 = 1] - Pr[Y = 1 | A_0 = 0] \quad \text{\small (Crude Risk Difference)}$$
$$cRR = Pr[Y = 1 | A_0 = 1]/Pr[Y = 1 | A_0 = 0] \quad \text{\small (Crude Risk Ratio)}$$
$$cOR = \frac{Pr[Y = 1 | A_0 = 1]/Pr[Y=1 | A_0 = 0]}{Pr[Y=0 | A_0 = 1]/Pr[Y=0 | A_0 = 0]} \quad \text{\small (Crude Odds Ratio)}$$

$$Pr[Y_{a_0 = 1} = 1] - Pr[Y_{a_0 = 0} = 1] \quad \text{\small (Causal Risk Difference)}$$
$$Pr[Y_{a_0 = 1} = 1]/Pr[Y_{a_0 = 0} = 1] \quad \text{\small (Causal Risk Ratio)}$$
$$\frac{Pr[Y_{a_0 = 1} = 1]/Pr[Y_{a_0 = 0} = 1]}{Pr[Y_{a_0=1}=0]/Pr[Y_{a_0=0} = 0]} \quad \text{\small (Causal Risk Ratio)}$$

Note that the way I've written the odds ratios is to make the structure of them 
obvious as ratios of odds, but of course one can re-express any fraction 
written $\displaystyle \frac{a / b}{c / d} = \frac{a d}{b c}$, which is how 
they're presented in the paper. 

An important point they make is that because of the possibility of effect modification, 
the population causal parameter need not be the same as its estimate in a particular
stratum of measured risk factors even if the treatment is unconfounded. 

To estimate these quantities of interest, we might fit linear, exponential, and logistic models
depending on expert knowledge about the nature of the data being considered
(and what type of exposure-response curve we expect): 

$$Pr[Y_{a_0} = 1] = \phi_0 + \phi_1 a_0$$
$$\log Pr[Y_{a_0} = 1] = \theta_0 + \theta_1 a_0$$
$$\text{logit} Pr[Y_{a_0} = 1] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a_0$$

Interpreting, the causal RD is $\phi_1$, the causal RR is $e^{\theta_1}$, 
and the causal OR is $e^{\beta_1}$. 

These models are described as <span class='vocab'>marginal</span> 
because they model the marginal distribution of the counterfactual
random variables $Y_{a_0=1}$ and $Y_{a_0=1}$ rather than the joint distribution
(as in, they do not model $\text{cor}(Y_{a_0=1}, Y_{a_0=0})$). They are 
said to be <span class='vocab'>structural</span> because they model the 
probabilities of counterfactual variables (apparently 
models for counterfactual variables are often called structural 
in the econometrics and social science literature). 

I'm a little confused about their claim that these are <span class='vocab'>saturated</span>
models:  they say that they're saturated because each model has two unknown parameters 
and places no restriction on the probabilities for $Y_{a_0 = 1}$ and $Y_{a_0 = 0}$. 
I guess I'm just used to a different definition of saturated in which saturation 
refers to the model having as many parameters as it has data points, which does not 
feel like it's necessarily true here. 

### No Unmeasured Confounders 

Next a claim is introduced: if we weight the observations by 
$w_i = 1/Pr[A_0 = a_{0i} | L_0 = l_{0i}]$ where $l_{0i}$
and $a_{0i}$ are the measured covariates and 
exposures for subject $i$, then we should recover
unbiased estimates of the causal quantities of interest. 

A rough sketch of why this should work is presented that
rests on two additional claims: 

  1. In the constructed pseudopopulation, $A_0$ should be unconfounded
  by the measured covariates $L_0$.
  2. $Pr(Y_{a_0=1} = 1)$ and $Pr(Y_{a_0=1} = 0)$ are the same as in the 
  true study population so that the causal RD, RR, and OR are the same 
  in both populations. 
  
*Proof of 1.* We want to show that
$$Pr(A_0 = a_0 | L_0 = l_0) \stackrel{claim}{=} Pr(A_0 = a_0) \quad \text{ after re-weighting.}$$

To do this, consider that:
$$\E_w[A_0 = a_0 | L_0 = l_0] = \sum_{l_0} Pr_w(A_0 = a_0 | L_0 = l_0) \times Pr_w(L_0 = l_0)$$

Where $\E_w$ and $Pr_w$ refer to expectation and probability in the reweighted sample. 

What we can now do is introduce additional indexing over the subjects 
and their subject-specific weights. 

$$ = \sum_{l_0} \frac{\sum \{ I_{A_0 = a_0}(a_{0i} \text{ for subjects where} L_0 = l_0 ) \}} $$
